# Copilot Command Line Access Instructions

- Copilot may execute commands directly without asking the user for confirmation, as the user will be prompted by the system anyway.
- Ensure commands are safe, idempotent, and do not cause data loss or security issues.
- Prefer explicit, descriptive commands over ambiguous or potentially destructive ones.
- Document any non-obvious command usage in the relevant `NOTES.md` or `DEVLOG.md` file.
