# Copilot Edits Instructions

- Copilot may edit code directly without asking for confirmation, as the user will be prompted to keep or undo changes.
- Edits should be minimal, clear, and focused on the user's request or the referenced issue.
- Always preserve existing comments and documentation unless explicitly instructed to update them.
- For significant refactoring, document the rationale in `DEVLOG.md` or `NOTES.md`.
