# Copilot Labeled Data Export Instructions

- Only modify `export.json` in response to explicit user requests or as part of a labeling workflow.
- Do not overwrite or remove data unless the user has confirmed the operation.
- Document any non-obvious changes in the relevant issue file or `DEVLOG.md`.
