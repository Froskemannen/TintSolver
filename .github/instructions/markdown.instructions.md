# Copilot Markdown Instructions

- Do not auto-edit documentation or markdown files unless explicitly requested by the user.
- When editing markdown, preserve the structure and intent of the file.
- For user-facing docs, keep language clear and accessible; for contributor docs, be precise and reference project conventions.
- Reference design decisions and rationale in `NOTES.md` and log chronological changes in `DEVLOG.md` when relevant.
