# Copilot Shell Script Instructions

- Ensure shell scripts are safe, idempotent, and do not cause data loss or security issues.
- Prefer explicit, descriptive commands and document any non-obvious usage in `NOTES.md` or `DEVLOG.md`.
- Only modify scripts in response to explicit user requests or as part of a tracked issue.
