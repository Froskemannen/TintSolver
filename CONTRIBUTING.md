# Contributing to TintSolver

Thank you for considering contributing to TintSolver! This document outlines best practices and guidelines for contributing to the project.

## How We Work

- **Issue-Driven Development:**
  - All major features, enhancements, and bugfixes are tracked as GitHub issues.
  - Each issue may have a corresponding markdown file in `docs/` or a checklist in the issue description.
  - Inline TODOs in code reference relevant issues for traceability.

- **Development Plan & Notes:**
  - High-level plans, architecture, and ongoing research are documented in this file and in `docs/` (e.g., `docs/issue_driven_git_flow.md`).
  - For implementation-specific notes, see inline code comments and TODOs.

- **Pull Requests:**
  - Reference the relevant issue number in your PR title and description.
  - Only commit to non-protected branches, preferably those connected to an issue or pull request.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Keep code modular and well-documented.
  - Use the provided scripts for setup and running Label Studio.
  - Follow the project structure as described in the main `README.md`.
